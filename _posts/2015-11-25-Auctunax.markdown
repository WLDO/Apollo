{% section_title Challenge %}
{% textalign center %}
I was hired on as Project Manager and Lead Designer for a start-up, tasked with the job to create a Learning Management System combined with a social element, where students can access class information, connect with Peers and Teachers to discuss class-work, & school-life. We were also tasked to design a Parent's Portal, so parents can keep track of Student progress and attendance, and allow teachers and parents to contact each other.
A small team of researchers and I spent a little under a year to research and design the entire system. The most Challenging items were the following:
{% endtextalign %}
{% features %}
Ensure the student remained engaged.
Maintain a high level of security.
Provide Students freedom to speak their minds.
Stand out above the competition.
{% endfeatures %}

{% section_title Solution %}
{% textalign center %}
In an effort to keep students engaged, our research found that it was important to provide the student access to both School-related information and Social information at the same time, so I designed a 2 column pane system that always displays both the fun and the serious sections at the same time. Students can also expand social sections to experience a larger feed.

To tackle the privacy issues, while allowing the students to speak their mind without thinking parents were always looking over their shoulder, we took the approach to allow students to send private messages to other school mates, but we wouldn't allow access to anybody outside of the school. Parents don't have access to view private messages, but students could chat in group forums, speak with Teachers and Faculty, Share thoughts, videos, photos, links and insights on their newsfeed, and view posts from others in their school.

To stand above the rest of the competition and get parents on board, we had to provide Parents a complete package. Allowing the parent to be more active in their child's lives. Parents get notified about emergencies, new grades, attendance, and due dates. We also took advantage of the built-in mobile technology hardware and gave parents the ability to approve a field trip permission slip by the scan of a fingerprint!

In addition to grades & due dates, Parents can chat directly with teachers. That means no more once-a-year meetings!

Parents can now be more involved than ever before with access to their child's LMS. Helping with Homework has never been easier!
