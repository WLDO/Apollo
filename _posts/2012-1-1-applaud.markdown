Applaud is a system that allows people in an audience to discover and purchase music played in a public space via a DJ, Band, or any Performing Artist. Fans can view nearby event information and information about the music currently playing at that event. The track information will always be correct, because the artist is connected to our system too!

We are also an online music store! We allow any artist to upload their music to our store. This way artists can finish making a song in the evening and begin selling it at their gig by night. They can even spread the new song to other DJs to play that night.

Fans have the option to purchase the music being played. They can purchase the track from our store or search for the track in Spotify, Soundcloud, iTunes, or other online stores.

{% textalign center %}
If a performing artist (or DJ) creates a successful transaction as a result of their performance, then we link the transaction or affiliate-link-press to the performing artist (or DJ). The original artist receives maximum royalties, and the performing artist is then given a commission or virtual credit as incentive for creating the sale and playing great music.
